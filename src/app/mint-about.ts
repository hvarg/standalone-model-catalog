                    The  Model Explorer is an application for finding and exploring software models and metadata available
                    in the MINT Model Catalog without having to interact with the APIs or clients designed for developers.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Users can search for existing software models by typing their names, categories or keywords.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once a model is selected, the application will show its available versions and software configurations
                    so users can explore their corresponding inputs and outputs.
                </p>

                </p> 
                <p>
                    If several software configurations are available for a particular model version, the application will 
                    display them side by side to enable comparison.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The Model Explorer is maintained in a 
                    <a href="https://github.com/mintproject/model-catalog-explorer" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a>,
                    and it is currently optimized for the Chrome browser.
